# Get CRUD to work in these routes
* You have 15 minutes

# SEQUELIZE
* Take 15 minutes to write the CRUD needed for creating, reading, updating and deleting todos
* Use your activity notes from class or any resources you need
* We'll review the solution together

## Notes:
`findAll` - is the same as "Select" in SQL (used in the example above).
`create` - is the same as "Insert" in SQL.
`update` - is the same as "Update" in SQL (and they're even called the same!).
`destroy` - is the same as "Delete" in SQL.
